We have a websit that apparently taking input from user

And now we can see that we have a session cookie after inspection the website.

i decoded the cookie using `flask-unsign` tool and it shows `{'very_auth':'snickerdoodle'}`

So now i went reviewing the flask code provided by the challenge and i noticed two things ,, the first thing is this route that checks if `session["very_auth"]` == `admin` and if true if routes flag.html

The second thing i noticed is that the flask code is signing the cookie with random secret_key from a list ,, so basically we can crack this session using `flask-unsign` because we can guess the secret_key .
